# aidoku-as
A fork of the AssemblyScript wrapper for Aidoku sources.

# What is the Objective of this Fork?

The official AssemblyScript wrapper is now unmaintained, since the Aidoku team has announced that going forward, only sources written in Rust will be accepted into the official source repository, and that the AssemblyScript wrapper will no longer be maintained.

This fork extends the life of the wrapper and provides the new APIs that will be implemented in the official Rust wrapper to the best of my ability.
